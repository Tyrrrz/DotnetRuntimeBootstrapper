‚úÖ **Project status: active**.

DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper replaces the default application host `exe` file generated by MSBuild for Windows executables with a fully featured bootstrapper that can download and install .NET runtime and other missing components required by your application.

> ‚ö† Bootstrapper only supports applications targeting .NET Core 3.0 or higher.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently, bootstrapper's user experience is optimized for desktop applications.
Using it with projects of other types (i.e. console or web) is possible but not recommended.

## Download

üì¶ [NuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper): `dotnet add package DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper`

## Features

- Detects and installs missing .NET runtime
- Detects and installs missing Visual C++ redistributable binaries
- Detects and installs missing Windows updates
- Provides GUI to guide the user through the installation process
- Interoperates with `hostfxr.dll` directly
- Routes command line arguments & environment variables
- Inherits version info, manifest, icons, and other resources
- Runs out-of-the-box on Windows 7 and higher
- Supports all CPU architectures in a single executable
- Integrates seamlessly into an existing MSBuild pipeline

## Usage

### Build integration

To add DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper to your project, simply install the corresponding [NuGet package](https://nuget.org/packages/DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper).
MSBuild will automatically pick up the `props` and `targets` files provided by the package and integrate them inside the build process.

It is highly recommended to edit your project file afterwards to make sure that the bootstrapper package is only referenced in the `Release` configuration.
Without this, you may not be able to run your application with a debugger because that relies on the original executable file being present.

```xml
<!-- Only use the bootstrapper for the release builds -->
<ItemGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)' == 'Release'">
  <PackageReference Include="DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper" Version="x.y.z" PrivateAssets="all" />
</ItemGroup>
```


Once that's done, building or publishing the project should produce two additional files in the output directory:

```ini
MyApp.exe                 <-- bootstrapper executable
MyApp.exe.config          <-- runtime config required by the executable
MyApp.dll
MyApp.pdb
MyApp.deps.json
MyApp.runtimeconfig.json
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to include the `.config` file when distributing your application.
Bootstrapper executable may not be able to run without it.

During build, DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper relies on the following common project-level properties for configuration:

- `<TargetFramework>` -- used to determine the version of .NET runtime checked by the bootstrapper
- `<AssemblyTitle>` -- used as a display name of the application shown by the bootstrapper
- `<ApplicationIcon>` -- used to locate the icon resource to inject it inside the bootstrapper
- `<ApplicationManifest>` -- used to locate the manifest resource to inject it inside the bootstrapper

### How it works

Bootstrapper executable is a pre-compiled binary built against legacy .NET Framework v3.5, which allows it to run out-of-the-box on all operating systems starting with Windows 7.
It's deployed during build by a custom MSBuild task in a series of steps:

1. Copy bootstrapper executable (`MyApp.exe`) to the output directory
2. Copy config file (`MyApp.exe.config`) to the output directory
3. Inject execution parameters (containing target file name, required runtime version, etc.) as an embedded resource inside the executable
4. Inject file metadata (`ProductName`, `FileDescription`, `FileVersion`, `ProductVersion`, `LegalCopyright`, etc.) inside the executable
5. Inject application icon and manifest resource files inside the executable

When the end-user runs `MyApp.exe`, the bootstrapper executable will first ensure that the required version of .NET runtime is available and then delegate execution to the target assembly.
In case the runtime or any of its prerequisites are missing, the user is prompted with an option to download and install them automatically.

### Troubleshooting

If the build process does not seem to produce the bootstrapper executable, you may get more information by running build (or publish) with higher verbosity.
For example, running `dotnet run --verbosity normal` on `DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper.Demo` project should produce output that contains the following section:

```txt
