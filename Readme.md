✅ **Project status: active**.

DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper replaces the default application host `exe` file generated by MSBuild for Windows executables with a fully featured bootstrapper that can automatically download and install .NET runtime and other missing components required by your application.

## Download

📦 [NuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper): `dotnet add package DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper`

## Features

- Detects and installs missing .NET runtime
- Detects and installs missing Visual C++ redistributable binaries
- Detects and installs missing Windows updates
- Provides GUI to guide the user through the installation process
- Runs the application directly through `hostfxr.dll`
- Routes command line arguments and environment variables
- Inherits version info, manifest, icons, and other resources
- Works out-of-the-box on Windows 7 and higher
- Supports all CPU architectures in a single executable
- Integrates seamlessly into existing MSBuild pipelines

## Usage

To add DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper to your project, simply install the corresponding [NuGet package](https://nuget.org/packages/DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper).
MSBuild will automatically pick up the `props` and `targets` files provided by the package and integrate them inside the build process.
After that, no further configuration is required.

> ⚠ Bootstrapper only supports applications targeting .NET Core 3.0 or higher.

> ⚠ Bootstrapper's user experience is optimized for **desktop applications**.
Other application platforms are supported in theory but not necessarily in practice.

### Publishing

In order to create a sharable distribution of your application, run `dotnet publish` as you normally would.
This should produce the following files in the output directory:

```txt
MyApp.exe                 <-- bootstrapper's application host
MyApp.exe.config          <-- .NET config required by the application host
MyApp.runtimeconfig.json  <-- runtime config required by the application host
MyApp.dll                 <-- your application
MyApp.pdb
MyApp.deps.json
[... other application dependencies ...]
```

Make sure to include all marked files in your application distribution.

> ⚠️ Self-contained and single-file application distributions are not supported by the bootstrapper.

### Application host

The client-facing side of DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper is implemented as a [custom .NET runtime host](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/netcore-hosting).
Internally, it's a pre-compiled managed executable built against legacy .NET Framework v3.5, which allows it to run out-of-the-box on all operating systems starting with Windows 7.

When the user runs the application through the bootstrapper, it executes these steps:

1. Attempts to locate existing .NET installation
2. Attempts to run the application via latest available `hostfxr.dll`
3. If that fails:
   1. Resolves the target runtime by reading the `runtimeconfig.json` file
   2. Checks if the required .NET runtime is missing
   3. Checks if any of .NET's prerequisites are missing
   4. Prompts the user to install the missing components
   5. Downloads and installs the missing components
   6. If necessary, prompts the user to reboot the system
   7. Runs the application again

### Application resources

When the bootstrapper is created, the build task injects important native resources from the target assembly into the application host:

- Application manifest (resource type: 24). Can be configured by the `<ApplicationManifest>` project property.
- Application icon (resource types: 3 and 14). Can be configured by the `<ApplicationIcon>` project property.
- Version info (resource type: 16). Contains values configured by `<FileVersion>`, `<InformationalVersion>`, `<Product>`, `<Copyright>`, and other similar project properties.

Additionally, the version info resource is further modified to contain the following attributes:

- `InternalName` set to the application host's file name.
- `OriginalName` set to the application host's file name.
- `AppHost` set to `.NET Runtime Bootstrapper (vX.Y.Z)` where `X.Y.Z` is the version of the bootstrapper.

### Options

By default, bootstrapper is only created when publishing the project (i.e. when running `dotnet publish`).
If you want to also have it created on every build, set the `<GenerateBootstrapperOnBuild>` project property to `true`:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>WinExe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net6.0-windows</TargetFramework>
    <!-- ... -->

    <!-- Create bootstrapper on every build, in addition to every publish -->
    <GenerateBootstrapperOnBuild>true</GenerateBootstrapperOnBuild>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <!-- ... -->

</Project>
```

> ⚠ Bootstrapper's application host does not support debugging.
In order to retain debugging capabilities of your application during local development, keep `<GenerateBootstrapperOnBuild>` set to `false` (default).

### Troubleshooting

#### Build task logs

If the build process does not seem to produce the bootstrapper correctly, you may be able to get more information by running the `build` or `publish` command with higher verbosity.
For example, running `dotnet publish --verbosity normal` on `DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper.Demo` project should produce output that contains the following section:

```txt
CreateBootstrapperAfterBuild:
 Extracting apphost...
 Extracted apphost to 'f:\Projects\Softdev\DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper\DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper.Demo\bin\Debug\net6.0-windows\DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper.Demo.exe'.
 Extracted apphost config to 'f:\Projects\Softdev\DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper\DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper.Demo\bin\Debug\net6.0-windows\DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper.Demo.exe.config'.
 Injecting target binding...
 Injected target binding to 'DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper.Demo.exe'.

 Injecting icon...
 Injected icon to 'DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper.Demo.exe'.
 Injecting version info...
 Injected version info to 'DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper.Demo.exe'.
 Bootstrapper created successfully.
```

#### Application host logs

In the event of a fatal error, in addition to showing a message to the user, bootstrapper will also produce a timestamped error dump in the application's directory (for example, `AppHost_Error_20211205001042.txt`).
If the bootstrapper does not have sufficient permissions to create a file in that directory, it will write it to `%LocalAppData%\Tyrrrz\DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper` instead.

The dump has the following format:

```txt
Timestamp: 05.12.2021 0:10:42 +02:00
AppHost: .NET Runtime Bootstrapper v2.0.0 (https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper)
Message: System.Exception: Test failure
   at DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper.AppHost.Program.Run(String[] args)
   at DotnetRuntimeBootstrapper.AppHost.Program.Main(String[] args)
```
